# Project Description

Meal Planner is a simple app that can be used to plan the recipes and meals that they would like to make for the week. It can be used to view recipes, search for specific types of recipes, add and view planned meals to a calendar and set notifications for times to start making meals.

# Note

This project was ported over from my university github account.
